    <h2>Diet Of Quokka</h2>
    <p>Like all other species in the Macropod family, quokkas are herbivores. They eat a wide variety of vegetation, ranging from shrubs, leaves, and bark, to grasses. <br>They will also steal “people food” from stores, especially when fed by tourists. This is highly discouraged, as human food is unhealthy for these cute little thieves.</p>
    <h2>Behaviour Of Quokka</h2>
    <p>These animals are nocturnal, which means they are most active at night. They roam in search of food, and <br>interact with others of their kind. Dominant males defend territories, and those territories often overlap with the range of female animals. <br>Gatherings of 25-150 animals are frequently seen around water sources.</p>
